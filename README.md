# Quality README-Generator

## Description

This project is to help any developer generate a quality README.md file quickly and efficiently using a CLI (Command Line Prompt) by answering a series of questions and receiving a file output.

## Installation
Node 
npm inquirer
npm fs

## Usage

Within the command line or terminal, enter [node index.js] to run the script. The script will prompt through questions that the user will respond. Those responses will be output in a README.md file.

## Credits

I have no official collaborators.

## Project Status

In progress, incomplete. 

I am currently stuck with an error in the command line. I continue to go around in a circle on .js vs .cjs. I have uninstalled the default inquirer and tried inquirer@^8.0.0 but still getting an error. for ES module scope.
